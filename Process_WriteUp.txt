						Storing School Data Project


STUDENT CLASS : This class implement the InterOp Inteface.It contains two properties named StudentName and Class.
It cointains the List of Students DataStructure to store the data of the student then the FileWrite() Method used to Write Student Data 
inside the Student.txt File for that I created a FileStream object with FileMode as Append and FileAcces as Write.then create a StreamWriter Object
to append the data which is entered by the user in the Format (StudentName-Class). I store the data in this format because it is easy to
Split the data while reading from the Student.txt File. Then FileRead() Method this method used to read the Student Data Whice we already Stored
in the Student.txt File and also it copy these student data inside the List. and finally PrintData() Method which iterate through the List Where we 
store our Student data and print the Student Data.

TEACHER CLASS : This class contains 3 Properties Teacher Name , Class and Subject and has a list of Teacher Datastructure.
it contains all the method same as the Student Class because it also implement the same interface IFileOperations but here the Difference is 
We store the data under Teacher.txt File. So every teacher in the list must have Name,Class and a Subject.

SUBJECT CLASS : This class cointains 2 Properties Subject Name and Subject Code. this is also contain all the methods Which are implemented on
Steudent and Teacher Class. this has the list of every subject and it's subject code.

Main Program : In the main method, created a Switch statement for Add,Print and search content in the application.
1 for Adding the content 2 for Printing the content 3 for search for a content. For example if the user entered 1 for adding content then the program asks 
user to specify the File he/she wants to write for that I wrote an another switch statement insdie the main switch then if the user entered again 1
student File is selected and it accept student name ans class and store inside the Student.txt File.
